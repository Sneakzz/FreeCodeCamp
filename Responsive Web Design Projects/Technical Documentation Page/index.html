        </header>

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
          Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
          environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
          elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
          of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document
            Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
            form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on
            a server.</li>
        </ul>

          <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
        </header>

        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
          language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
          most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it
          was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
          system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has
          a
          prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
          provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
          supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
          executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
          and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
          do
          not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

      <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </header>

        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
          code:</p>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) {
          alert("Hello " + yourName);
          }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>

        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

      </section>

      <section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h1>Declaring Variables</h1>
        </header>

        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p> With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <code>
          var x = 42.
        </code>

        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code>
          x = 42.
        </code>

        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
          variant.</p>

        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code>
          let y = 13.
        </code>

        <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="constants" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h1>Constants</h1>
        </header>

        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is
          the
          same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
          alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>

        <code>
          const PI = 3.14;
        </code>

        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to
          be
          initialized to a value.</p>

        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
          omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>

        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>

        <code>
          // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
          function f() {};
          const f = 5;
          // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO
          function f() {
          const g = 5;
          var g;
          //statements
          }
        </code>

        <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>

        <code>
          const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};
          MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
        </code>

      </section>

      <section id="data_types" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h1>Data Types</h1>
        </header>

        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the
                same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with
          your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
          objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
